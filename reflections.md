# Reflection on GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template
One of the main challenges encountered during the selection process was identifying a GitHub Project template that best fits the requirements of a **Real-Time Weather Tracking System**. The **Basic Kanban** template lacked automation, which is crucial for tracking ongoing weather updates. The **Team Planning** template was more suited for long-term milestones rather than Agile sprint cycles. Ultimately, the **Automated Kanban** template was selected due to its ability to automate task movement and streamline Agile workflows.

While the **Automated Kanban** template was beneficial, some automation features needed to be adjusted. For example, not all issues needed automatic progression through columns, as some required manual review before moving to the next stage. Additionally, custom columns such as **Testing** and **Blocked** had to be added to better align with the projectâ€™s development cycle.

## Comparison with Other Project Management Tools
### GitHub Projects vs. Trello
GitHub Projects and Trello both offer visual task management, but Trello is more intuitive and easier to use for non-technical teams. Trello allows for easy drag-and-drop task movement but lacks deep integration with version control systems. GitHub Projects, on the other hand, seamlessly integrates with **GitHub Issues** and repositories, making it ideal for software development projects like the **Real-Time Weather Tracking System**.

### GitHub Projects vs. Jira
Jira is a powerful tool for Agile teams, offering advanced sprint tracking, backlog prioritization, and detailed reporting. However, its complexity can be overwhelming for smaller projects. **GitHub Projects** provides a simpler approach while still offering automation, issue linking, and status tracking, making it a more lightweight yet effective choice.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Automation can improve efficiency**, but it needs careful configuration to align with project needs.
2. **Adding custom columns like "Testing" and "Blocked" improved workflow transparency**, helping the team track issues more effectively.
3. **GitHub Projects is well-suited for Agile software development** due to its integration with repositories and pull requests.
4. **While Jira is feature-rich, GitHub Projects offers a more streamlined experience** for managing development tasks directly from the codebase.

By leveraging the **Automated Kanban** template, we successfully implemented a structured workflow for tracking the development and deployment of the **Real-Time Weather Tracking System**, ensuring smooth progress and timely issue resolution.
