Reflection
Challenges Faced:

"One challenge was choosing a template that balanced automation with manual flexibility. The Automated Kanban template had too much automation for some tasks, so we had to tweak it manually."

Comparison with Other Tools:

GitHub Projects vs. Trello: Trello is more visual and easier to use but lacks direct GitHub integration for issue tracking.

GitHub Projects vs. Jira: Jira offers more advanced sprint planning but can be overly complex for a small project. GitHub Projects integrates directly with repositories, making it ideal for software development teams.
